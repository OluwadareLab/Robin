A poorly named component that is used in many places in the website. Be aware that this is a wrapper for the html Form element named the exact same 
as the component its wrapping.  
Form example:

```js
<Form fields={[
    {title:"Example field",
    name:"example Name",
    required:true,
    inputType:"text"
    },
    {title:"Example field 2",
    name:"example Name",
    required:true,
    inputType:"text"
    },
    {title:"Example field 3",
    name:"example Name",
    required:true,
    inputType:"text"
    }
    ]}/>
```
